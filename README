If you dont want a presence then leave Client: "" blank, you can have as many messages as you want, just lay them out like a table and itll go through
all of them
If you want ClientID and dont know how to find it through your app use a tutorial!
You can have only 2 buttons MAX, if you have any more than 2, they wont be shown, if you just want one button then delete the second table
if you want no buttons, delete both tables and leave Buttons: []

url on the buttons is the link you want the person to be redirected to when they press it.
